# React Portfolio
## Description
This is my professional portfolio. It is built with React. You will find my contact info in the footer as well as a short bio about me and a couple of projects I completed. As well as a group project (Weekly Meal Planner) that I collaborated with my classmates to complete.
## User Story
```
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
